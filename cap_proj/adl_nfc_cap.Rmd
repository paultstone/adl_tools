Methodology:  
* The top 45 salaries for each team composes the projected 2023 roster  
* From this roster, contracts which will expire in 2024 are discarded  
* The resulting contracts are summed for each team  
* This sum is multiplied by 110% to reflect yearly contract increases  
* Any fifth year option (5YO) salaries or carry-over salary adjustments are added
